/**
 * Does the rehearsal actually CATCH anything?
 *
 * A rehearsal that only ever passes is decoration, and a green cloud run would
 * tell nobody anything. These tests drive `runRehearsalCases` against an
 * in-memory backend whose behaviour can be broken on purpose, and assert that
 * the case which exists to catch each defect is the case that goes red.
 *
 * This is the same discipline as the mutation battery on the client ratchet: the
 * instrument gets attacked before its output is quoted.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVIDENCE BOUNDARY. The fake below is a MODEL of the deposit-release
 * contract, not the product. It proves the ASSERTIONS discriminate; it proves
 * nothing about Convex, and in particular its `fireConcurrentReleases` stand-in
 * cannot interleave anything. Real interleaving is exactly what the cloud run
 * exists for, and nothing here substitutes for it.
